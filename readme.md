## College Course Feedback System

This repository contains the source code for our proposed solution to improve the existing college course feedback system, making it more user-friendly and efficient for both students and faculty members. Our primary goals are:

- Ability to save progress and return later to complete incomplete submissions.

#### For Administrators / Instructors:
- User-friendly drag-and-drop form builder for creating customizable feedback questionnaires.
- Pre-built templates library for common types of evaluation criteria.
- Option to restrict access based on enrollment status or other relevant factors.
- Easy management of active surveys through an admin panel.

#### For Data Analysis:
- Real-time reporting features showcasing results via charts, graphs, tables, etc.
- Exportable reports in various formats like PDF, CSV, XLSX, or JSON.
